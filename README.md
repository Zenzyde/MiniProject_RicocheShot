# MiniProject_RicocheShot
A projectile deflection, mini-project game made for the simple purpose of using the Poisson Disc Sampling algorithm and a bullet-bounce mechanic in a game. It's a pretty chill but quite strategic prototype with the goal of gathering as many points as possible with a limited amount of bullets per round by destroying as many pillars as possible with a single shot. Made with the Unity engine using C#.

Visual example of the miniproject-game in action:

The following shows how the game looks in editor:
* The green rays and yellow balls that control the tilting and sinking of a pillar when it is hit.
* The green balls that mark where a pillar has spawned, free-floating green balls mark locations where pillars were deleted to provide some variety in level layout.
* The red line that visualizes the path the bullet will take when being shot.
* The white square which visualizes the area where pillars are able to spawn.
