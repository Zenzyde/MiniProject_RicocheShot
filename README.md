# MiniProject_RicocheShot
A projectile deflection, mini-project game made for the simple purpose of using the Poisson Disc Sampling algorithm and a bullet-bounce mechanic in a game. It's a fast-paced prototype with the goal of gathering as many points as possible within a given time frame by destroying as many pillars as possible with a single shot. Made with the Unity engine using C#. in a game.

Visual example of the miniproject-game in action:

![Shooting-deflection game visual](/images/Ricoshet_Shot_early_alpha_new.gif)
* Remaining time for a given round is displayed at the top
* The total amount of points gathered is displayed below the time
* The current amount of points gathered, based on the amount of pillars hit per shot, is displayed below the total point amount
* A special point bonus is displayed at the bottom, increasing with the amount of pillars that were hit per shot

The shot is visualized with a red "lazer" which indicates the path the bullet will bounce
